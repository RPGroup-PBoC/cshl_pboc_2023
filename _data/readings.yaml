    This very insightful article gives a wide ranging introduction to the modern
    state of the art in animal tracking. Every figure tells an important story.

    This paper is a useful resource for thinking about the biomass of
    grasslands, relevant to our thinking for both the migration of wildebeest
    and the grazing of our cattle.

    This paper gives a very insightful overview of the technologies that are
    needed to study collective motions of animals.

    This paper takes a critical look at the generation of “big data” associated
    with animal movements. Though we are incredibly enthusiastic about GPS
    tracking, the arguments here remind us of our own thinking on the way that
    DNA sequencing and structural biology have created a similar big data
    pressure head in the molecular interpretation of life that might be
    similarly misleading.

     If you are to read one paper from our list on the fascinating and inspiring
     topic of animal movements (and the wildebeest in particular), this is
     it. The paper ranges from how measurements are done, to the kinds of data
     that result to the kinds of models that are needed to come to terms with
     that data
