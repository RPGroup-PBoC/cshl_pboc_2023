   title: Distinguishing technology from biology:a critical review of the use of GPS telemetry data in ecology
   authors: Mark Hebblewhite and Daniel T. Haydon
   year: 2010
   link: hebblewhite2010.pdf
   description: > 
    This paper takes a critical look at the generation of “big data” associated
    with animal movements. Though we are incredibly enthusiastic about GPS
    tracking, the arguments here remind us of our own thinking on the way that
    DNA sequencing and structural biology have created a similar big data
    pressure head in the molecular interpretation of life that might be
    similarly misleading.

   title: From single steps to mass migration:the problem of scale in the movementecology of the Serengeti wildebeest
   authors: Colin J. Torney, J. Grant C. Hopcraft, Thomas A. Morrison, Iain D. Couzin, and Simon A. Levin

   link: torney2017.pdf
   description: >
     If you are to read one paper from our list on the fascinating and inspiring
     topic of animal movements (and the wildebeest in particular), this is
     it. The paper ranges from how measurements are done, to the kinds of data
     that result to the kinds of models that are needed to come to terms with
     that data

   title: What Is Mathematics For?
   authors: Underwood Dudley. 
   year: 2010
   link: dudley2010.pdf
   description: >
    This is just a fun little excursion into where mathematics fits in our
    education. I find it a refreshing antidote to specious arguments about the
    role (i.e. non role) of mathematics in our daily lives.

   title: Patterns of predation in a diverse predator–prey system
   authors: Tony Sinclair, Simon Mduma, and Justin Brashares.

    of animals and human annotation by citizen scientists.
