     description: >
      As Madhav mentioned in class, we can take a more 'appropriate' approach to simulating
      stochastic processes by considering the fact that rates are variable, and we often 
      only speak in terms of average rates. This tutorial walks you through a Gillespie 
      simulation for expression from a constitutive promoter.
