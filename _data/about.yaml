title: >
  Physical Biology of the Cell 

Summary: >
  It is a wonderful time to be thinking about the workings of the living world.
  Historic advances in molecular biology, structural biology and the use of
  biophysical techniques such as optical traps have provided an unprecedented
  window on the mechanics of the cell. The aim of this course is to study the
  cell and its components using whatever tools we need in order to make
  quantitative and predictive statements about cellular life. The main
  intellectual thread of the course will be the idea that the type of
  quantitative data which is becoming routine in biology calls for a
  corresponding quantitative modeling framework. The plan of this course is to
  elucidate general principles with exciting case studies.

#   We will keep this website updated with links to relevant publications and small
#   problems to help you get a quantitative feel for viruses.
